-- This script is automatically run after seeding
-- It updates passwords to use proper bcrypt hashing
-- Run this if you need to reset passwords to 'password123'

-- Note: You should run the Node.js script instead:
-- node scripts/update-passwords.js

-- This SQL file is kept for reference only
-- The actual password hashing must be done via bcrypt in Node.js
